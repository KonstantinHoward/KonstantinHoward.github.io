            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I began playing the saxophone in fourth grade at my public elementary school. 
              By the end of middle school, I decided that I would be playing for the rest of my life.
            In high school, I was introduced to jazz and it has been my passion ever since. Currently,
            I play in the Princeton Music Department's big band "Creative Large Ensemble" and its small combos.
            When I am home, I play with my longtime friends in a alternative rock band (the style is hard to pin down)
            called <a href="https://linktr.ee/HanoiRagmen">Hanoi Ragmen</a>. We have performed at DC venues like DC9,
            Pearl Street Warehouse, Union Stage and Howard Theatre and released our debut album, The Oldlight, in 2022.
            Here, I plan to share solo transcriptions, arrangements, and maybe even some recordings of what I've been working on.
          </p>

            <h2>Transcriptions</h2>
            <p>The best way to learn improvisation is to transcribe and study the solos of the greats who came before.
              I always learn a solo in its entirety by ear first, and then sometimes commit it to writing.
              Here are some of the solos I have transcribed over the years, heavily biased towards alto saxophone.
              I have also put several of these on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@khoward6584">YouTube</a>.

            <h2>Arrangements and Compositions</h2>
            <p>I have been wanting to arrange tunes for small groups and have a lot of ideas floating around.
              As I flesh them out, I will share them here. As for original compositions, I am taking a course on it
              this semester and am hoping to write a song for our next Hanoi Ragmen album.
