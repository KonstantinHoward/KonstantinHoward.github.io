            <h3><b>Estimating Tumor Necrosis in Glioblastoma Histologies</b></h3>
            <p> Abstract: Glioblastoma is an aggressive cancer in the brain capable of killing a victim within six months
              and with a 17% survival rate after two years [12]. Immediate diagnosis and rapid treatment is
              essential to survival. However, pathologists still diagnose and analyze tumors manually by studying
              microscopic slide images (histologies) from tumor biopsies, an inefficient and error-prone process.
              This project contributes to ongoing research efforts to automate histopathology with machine
              learning tools by attempting to build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the percent tumor
              necrosis in glioblastoma tumor histologies. This metric of tumor analysis proved to be a difficult
              problem: our model achieved at best a 37% accuracy in ten-way classification by patch, but did well
              in estimating a range of necrosis percent values by considering its top predicted classes. Despite a
              lightweight design and minimal training, our model shows promise for future research in tumor
              necrosis detection and estimation with highly-labeled data.

            <h3><b>Modeling the Perception of Similarity in Musical Chords</b></h3>
            <p>My first experience in independent research was my junior fall semester in Tom Griffith's computer science
                and psychology course Probabistic Models of Cognition. Under the advising of graduate student
                Raja Marjieh, I explored the question of how we perceive similarity between musical chords. There
                are many models of similarity, usually represented by some distance function, that have been proffered.
                I tested several of these models along with a new one, consonance difference, againt survey data that Marjieh
                had already gathered in other research. I used Python to implement the similarity models and perform 
                data analysis. My work found that the minimal voice-leading distance model worked best, that consonance difference
                is a predictor of chord similarity, and that combining the power of both these models increased our ability
                to predict perceived similarity. You can see my Jupyter Notebooks and report on GitHub (unfortunately, I cannot share
                the data yet as it is unpublished).

          <h3><b>Advanced Replacement Cache Simulation</b></h3>
          <p>For my final project in Principles of System Design, I partnered with my friends Aidan Walsh and Gavin
            Leising to implement and analyze ARC. We studied the original paper from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast03/tech/full_papers/megiddo/megiddo.pdf">
            IBM</a> and implemented a simulation of the caching algorithm using Golang. ARC is an adaptive cache containing
            least recently used (LRU) and least frequently used (LFU) queues whose sizes adapt according to the needs of workload.
            We analyzed its performance in comparison to basic LRU algorithm by using simulated workloads generated by a trace.
            The algorithm was fun to learn about and a powerful example of an adaptive data structure.

          <p>One of my biggest personal projects to date is this website, which I have been working on since January 4, 2023. I had 
            never done any kind of web development before, so it has been a fun learning experience. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and all of its files are stored in this public repository. 
            I am using HTML and CSS to build the website and Bootstrap 5 as a framework. I would like to learn and use some JavaScript in here too.
