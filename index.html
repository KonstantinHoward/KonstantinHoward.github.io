          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> Hello there! My name is Konstantin Howard and this is my personal website.
            I have many disparate interests and projects and I thought it high time 
            that I consolidate them in one location. Here you can check out what I've been
            up to musically, academic research papers and projects, and some cool photos I've taken. 
            But first, here's a little about me...
          </p>
          <p> I am currently an undergraduate student at Princeton University in the great class
            of 2024. My concentration is in <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/"> Computer Science </a> 
            but I am also pursuing certificates Russian, Eastern European, and Eurasian Studies 
            (<a href="https://reees.princeton.edu/">REEES</a>) and <a href="https://jazzatprinceton.com/"> 
            Jazz Studies</a>. I love to learn about the world around me, from science and engineering to the
            history and politics. Machine learning and aerospace software applications in particular interest me 
            and I care deeply about using these tools for good. Music occupies most of my time outside the classroom,
            playing saxophone in various departmental ensembles, student projects, and my DMV-based band 
            <a href= "https://linktr.ee/HanoiRagmen"> Hanoi Ragmen</a>. For a summary, see my 
            <a href="Photos/Konstantin_Howard_Resume .pdf">resume</a>. Enjoy the site! </p>

        <p> A note about the website. I began this project on January 4, 2023.
           It is all developed by me and is constantly evolving as I teach myself HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. </p>
